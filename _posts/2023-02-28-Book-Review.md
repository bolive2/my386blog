Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World, written by Meredith Broussard, is a compelling exploration of the limitations of computer systems and the myth of their infallibility. The book is an eye-opening journey that challenges the widely held perception that technology is neutral and objective. Broussard argues that computers are not as intelligent as we think and are not capable of replacing human judgment.

One aspect of the book that I particularly liked is how Broussard dismantles the notion that algorithms are inherently objective. She demonstrates how algorithmic bias can reinforce and perpetuate societal injustices, including racial and gender discrimination. Additionally, Broussard presents clear and concise explanations of complex technical concepts, making the book accessible to readers with little to no technical background.

However, I found that at times the book is repetitive and overly technical. Although Broussard provides numerous examples of how computers misunderstand the world, some of them feel redundant, and the technical explanations may overwhelm readers who are not familiar with computer systems.

Overall, Artificial Unintelligence is an insightful and thought-provoking read. Broussard's arguments are well-researched and compelling, and her writing style is engaging. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the impact of technology on society, especially those who want to gain a better understanding of the limitations of computer systems.
