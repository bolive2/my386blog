## How to Order a List of Numbers
The goal of this post is to show you how to take a list of integers and order them from least to greatest or greatest to least by using a for loop. This same idea will work for other programming languages. You will just have to change the syntax to match whatever language you decide to use. In the example I will be be doing, I will be using Python and ordering the list from least to greatest.
1. You need a list of unordered integers (if you are using a different, a similar data structure will work)
    x = (6,1,7,8,3,2)
2. Now you will want to initial the for loop to the length of the list.
    for i in range(len(x)):
3.
