I know a lot about programming and the way certain things work but I lack the web scrapping and a lot of application parts so blogs connecting the two would be good.
As far as topics and data to use, I love all things sports. There are plenty of sports data sets but recently I have loved watching golf. I bet there are data sets with putting
percentages and fairways hit and things like that.
